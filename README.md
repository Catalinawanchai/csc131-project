# CSC 131 Project - CalTrans PDF Management Tool

## Step #1: Downloads and Installation

### Become a Contributor

* Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the website to become a contributor to this project.
* If you're unfamiliar with Git or how GitHub works, it may be helpful to read the documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).
* A video that may also be useful: [Learn GitHub in 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhNq2kIvi9s)

### Dependencies

* Windows (x32 or x64) or MacOS (x64)
* Any IDE capable of running Java Projects (Preferably [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/))
* [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows) (JDK)
* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (If you're unfamiliar with Git)
* [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) (Optional)

### Installation

1. Install any IDE capable of efficiently running Java Projects (Preferably [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/))
2. Make sure you have the Java Development Kit installed. To check, just open a command prompt (or terminal) and type `java --version`.
   - If an error occurs, download and install the latest version [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows).
3. Download [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download) and run the installer. Once finished, make sure you're able to run a program called "LibreOffice Draw."
4. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and run the installer.
5. Finally, as an **optional step**, you can install [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) to get a better idea of how our PDF files will look and function in the field.

### Verification

* Verify that your installed IDE of choice opens and functions without issue.
* Verify that you now have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed properly by typing `java --version` in a command prompt or terminal window.
* Open LibreOffice Draw and open any PDF file `File > Open`. If successful, you've properly installed LibreOffice.
* Login to GitHub Desktop and clone this repository to your local machine: `File > Clone Repository > csc131-project`. (This will not work if you have not `forked` this repository).
* If you've chosen to install Adobe Acrobat Reader, simply repeat the steps for LibreOffice Draw to verify it works.

If everything is successful, congratulations! You're nearly there. If not, feel free to shoot a message in the project Discord and I'll answer as quickly as possible.

## Step #2: Getting Started

* Start your IDE and click `File > Import`, then choose `Existing Maven Project`.
  - Import the project folder you cloned earlier through GitHub Desktop into your IDE. It's likely located in `Documents > GitHub Projects` unless you specified a different location during installation. You **must** import this project as a *Maven* Project or it will improperly load the packages.
  - **FYI**: Maven is a Java project management tool made by Apache, which is the library being used for this project.
* Start LibreOffice Draw and open the PDF included in this repository titled `pdf-java.pdf`.
* Go to `View > Toolbars > Form Controls`, then press the little dropdown arrow on the menu that pops up and hit `Dock Toolbar`.
  - This places all the tools we (should) need for this project at the top of the program for easier access.
  - I've added a couple of text boxes and labels onto the document for you to play around with.
* Next, right-click either of the two text-entry boxes on the form and press `Control Properties`.
  - This allows us to edit any attribute of this item on the form, whether through Java code (easier) or manually through the menu.
  - Don't mistake it for `Form Properties`, as that is completely different and lists the attributes of the entire file itself.
* Finally, there's a `PDFtest.java` file in the `main` package that manipulates the elements currently on the `pdf-java.pdf` file.
  - As a final test, try editing the strings in this file to something different like "Hello, World" and run the program.
  - If it runs without any errors, congrats! You should open the PDF to see that your changes were applied and saved.
  - Please feel free to make any additional classes, modules, interfaces, etc., as you like - given they have comments to explain what they do.

## Step #3: Resources and Submitting Code

### Resources and Helpful Links

* Markdown for updating README or LICENSE: [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
* PDFBox Documentation (Library): [here](http://pdfbox.org)
* A simplified guide to setting things up: [here](https://dev.to/sandrogiacom/how-to-create-and-fill-out-your-own-pdf-form-with-java-87b)
* Discord invite in case you can't login or lose access to your account: [here](https://discord.gg/t2WvUKhHAA)

### Submitting Code

* If you're already familiar with Git or how GitHub works, you can skip this part. Otherwise, here's a brief explanation:
  - When editing code, adding files, or making any type of changes within the project folder, changes are logged to GitHub Desktop and are "staged" for submission to this repository.
  - In Git, there are things known as `branches`. Every engineer has their own branch. Branches are what hold code for review by other developers where your code can either be approved or sent back to you for revisions in case something's wrong or needs changing. Once your code is approved/accepted, it gets `pushed` to the `main` branch. This `main` branch is the "master" branch where your code can be seen by anyone and is now an official part of the project.
  - This system allows for neat, tidy, and orderly programming while working with a team of people.
* Now that you're a little more familiar with how branches work, it's time to make your own branch and start committing code.
* It's super simple, just open GitHub Desktop and click the large box near the top that says `Current branch`. Next, click `New Branch`. Finally, give it a name - typically with small teams like ours, you'd just name it something like `RyanBranch` or `JoeBranch` so your first name is followed by `Branch`. This just makes it easy to identify who is who.
* As stated previously, all changes you make to the project folder are logged to GitHub Desktop and you will see them on the left-hand side of the program. To `commit` (submit) your code to your branch for review, just enter a brief title of what you did in the `Summary (required)` text box at the bottom left and click `Commit to ___Branch`.
* Finally, if you're completely happy with your changes, you can `push` them to your branch which submits it to me for review. Click the box at the top right that says `Push to Branch`. It may also say `Push to origin`. Then, make a `pull request` by clicking the box at the top that says "Current branch" and selecting the "Pull requests" tab. There should be a button or a link that says "Would you like to [create a pull request](https://github.com/ryan-farruggia/csc131-project/pulls) from the current branch?" Click this link and it will take you to the website. Last step: click the green button that says "New Pull request" and then "Create pull request." Delete your branch *after* your pull request has been **accepted (not after you submit)** and create a new one.

Well done!
